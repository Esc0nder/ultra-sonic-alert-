this uses discord web hooks and esp32 and an ultra sonic sensor 
to alert you when something is detected,i came up with this idea cause my kitten keeps escaping out my backdoor, its quite a simple project tbh
but i still thought it might be worth posting anyway

what youll need:

esp32(i use the esp-wroom-32 but should work on others)

HC-SR04 ultrasonic sensor

jumper/dupont wires


optional:

LED

breadboards

pinout:
ultrasonic sensor to esp

VCC -> 5V

TRIG -> G5

ECHO -> G18

GND -> 


optional-pinout:

led to esp

led+ -> G2

led- -> GND
